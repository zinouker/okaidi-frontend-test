Below you will find the instructions of this exercise.

## Before beginning

Keep in mind that:

- You do not have to find the right solution, we are interested in the way you'll conceive your program.
- You should give the exercise a limited amount of time: **2 to 3 hours** should be good enough (you have one week maximum to return the assignment).
- Keep in mind your code quality will be appreciated.

## Instructions

### Exercise

Using the Open Trivia DataBase API (https://opentdb.com/api.php), build a game where the user:

- [x] can pick an answer, and see when he's right or wrong ;
- [x] is limited by a countdown ;

- There is only five question and the user can only see one question at a time.
  Hint: you'll most likely need a "next" button to see the next question.
- the type of question has to be "Multiple Choice" but you can chose the "Difficulty".

Feel free to read the API doc here => https://opentdb.com/

## Notes

### General

- You can't use any library or framework, everything has to be written in vanilla JavaScript.
- Leave comments where you think there should be.
- The design of the game is up to you, we ask you to make it responsive and use CSS3.
- However, CSS frameworks are to be avoided.
